This is a manual and automated website management system that deals with physiotherapy videos.
Apparently while looking at the project we have already deleted the FIREBASE project behind the system.
And many modules have already expired so there will be failures
His main idea was to create a web crawler that would look for physiotherapy videos and upload them to a donor database for the benefit of a website we built.
